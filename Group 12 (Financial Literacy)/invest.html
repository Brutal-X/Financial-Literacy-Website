            <h2>How To Invest</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Self-Directed Investing:</b>The answer to the question "how to invest" depends on whether you are a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) type of investor or would rather have a professional manage your money.
                    Due to the low commissions and simplicity of trading on their platforms, many investors who prefer to handle their own funds have accounts at discount or online brokerages.
                    DIY investing, also known as self-directed investment, calls for a good deal of knowledge, expertise, time commitment, and emotional restraint. 
                    If you don't fit these descriptions, it could be a better idea to let a professional manage your money.</li>
                
                <li><b>Professionally-Managed Investing:</b>Wealth managers typically handle investments for investors who seek professional money management. AUM, or assets under management, is the standard proportion that wealth managers charge their clients as their fee.
                    Even though hiring a professional money manager costs more than managing money on one's own, 
                    some investors are willing to pay for the ease of having an expert handle the research, investment decisions, and trading.</li>
                
                <li><b>Robotic investment advice:</b>Some investors decide which investments to make based on advice from computerized financial consultants. 
                    Roboadvisors, which use algorithms and artificial intelligence to generate recommendations, compile vital data about the investor and their risk profile.
                    Roboadvisors, which operate with little to no human intervention, provide services akin to those of a human investment advisor at a lower cost. With technological developments, roboadvisors can now do more than just choose assets. They can aid in the creation of retirement plans as well as the administration of trusts and other retirement accounts like 401(k)s.</li>
