            </p>
            <h2>THE EMERGING OF IoT</h2>
            <h3>How is IoT relevant for business ?</h3>
            <p>
                The internet of things, or IoT, is a network of connected computing devices, mechanical and digital  machines, objects, animals, or people that can exchange data over a network without requiring human interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                IoT devices easily remove process restrictions and solve conventional business challenges. As a result, firms are able to optimize everything, experience more production, cut costs, and do a lot more.
                Consider these 4 typical business needs that IoT provides excellent support for.
            </p>
            <h2>Access Control</h2>
            <p>
                rnet-enabled smart locks can be useful for manufacturing and retail businesses. These
             are the ideal instances of how IoT effortlessly resolves complex company issues.
             Businesses may regulate access to physical places without the usual limitations thanks 
             to smart locks. Smart locks enable anything with just a few clicks, including changing 
             passwords from a distance, tracking all accesses, and easily canceling access.
            </p>
            <h2>Monitoring/Event Recording</h2>
            <p>
                Smart cameras are an excellent example of how IoT devices can help small businesses.
                These Internet-connected video cameras may capture footage in high definition and 
                upload it to the cloud. As a result, companies are spared the expense of purchasing
                closed-circuit cameras, which can cost between R1,000 and R4,000 each. Any company 
                that needs to record extensive amounts of video cannot ignore the cost savings.
            </p>
            <h2>Dynamic Inventory Management</h2>
            <p>
                The usefulness of smart RFID tags for companies that deal in fast-moving consumer
                     goods (FMCGs) is enormous. These little gadgets show how IoT can give businesses 
                     productivity advantages that have never been seen before.You can affix these 
                     reasonably priced RFID tags on goods. Then, portable devices can document 
                     activities like sales, returns, quarantine for quality assurance, etc. This
                    significantly accelerates retail operations.
            </p>
            <h2>Equipment Maintenance</h2>
            <p>
                For many small firms, downtime is the scourge of their lives. Equipment failures 
                typically take many hours to recover from, and they cost businesses on average 
                R10,000 per hour.Imagine being able to do upkeep and repairs before any downtime 
                occurs! That sounds magical, doesn't it? IoT sensors have that kind of power.
                IoT sensors can alert small businesses to an approaching breakdown so they can
                appoint a technician in advance to minimize downtime when they are configured 
                appropriately. This is preferable to trying to control everything after a collapse 
                has already happened.
            </p>
            <h2>THE UGLY REALITY</h2>
            <P>
                SMMEs run businesses in both the city and townships in South Africa. Concerns have been raised concerning their failure rate and incapacity to achieve a competitive edge, particularly in the current era of rapid adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs).
            </P>
            <h3>Factors affecting ICT adoption in township SMMEs</h3>
            <P>
                According to the "The Southern African Journal of Entrepreneurship and Small Business Management" written by <b>Dr Stella Bvuma and Carl Marnewick</b> in terms of ICT adoption, South African township SMMEs appear to be falling behind and making no progress, as the majority of them are still limited to using just traditional business practices devoid of ICTs. Studies on ICT adoption haven't given township SMMEs much attention. Lack of ICT skills has been cited by various authors as one of 
                the barriers towards ICT adoption  (Jaganathan et al. 2018; 
                Mwila & Ngoyi 2019; Yadav, Yadav, Malik 2019). The research has shown that the reason they aren't using alternative ICT is because they don't know which ones are best or most appropriate for their line of work and because they lack the skills required to get more familiar with potential ICT. Reasons for not adopting to ICTs include perceived high cost of ICTs, ICT infrastructure, and ICT awareness or knowledge.
